# Collaborative Whiteboard - User Guide

Welcome to the Collaborative Whiteboard application! This guide will help you understand how to use the whiteboard for real-time collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Joining a Whiteboard

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. On the home screen, you'll see a field to enter a room code
3. Either:
   - Enter an existing room code shared with you, OR
   - Generate a random room code by clicking the dice icon, OR
   - Create your own code (6-8 alphanumeric characters)
4. Click "Join Room" to enter the whiteboard

### Sharing with Others

To collaborate with others:
1. Share your room code with them (e.g., via email, chat, etc.)
2. They should enter the same room code on their device
3. Once they join, you'll see the user count increase
4. Their cursor will appear on your screen as they move their mouse

## Using the Whiteboard

### Drawing Tools

The toolbar at the top of the whiteboard provides several options:

- **Colors**: Click on a color circle to select your drawing color
- **Width**: Use the slider to adjust your stroke width
- **Clear Canvas**: Click the "Clear Canvas" button to erase everything (affects all users)

### Drawing on the Canvas

- **Start Drawing**: Click and hold the left mouse button, then move your mouse
- **Stop Drawing**: Release the mouse button
- **View Others' Drawing**: As others draw, their strokes will appear in real-time
- **See Cursors**: Other users' cursor positions are shown with colored cursor icons

### Persistent Drawings

Your drawings are automatically saved to the room and will persist even if you leave and come back later:

- **Automatic Saving**: Every stroke you draw is automatically saved to the server
- **Room Persistence**: When you rejoin a room using the same code, all previous drawings will be restored
- **Long-term Storage**: Drawings in a room are preserved for up to 30 days after the last activity
- **Shared Persistence**: All users joining the same room will see the same saved drawings

### Tips for Effective Collaboration

1. **Coordinate Verbally**: Use a separate voice chat or video call to discuss what you're drawing
2. **Take Turns**: Avoid drawing in the same area simultaneously for best results
3. **Use Different Colors**: Assign different colors to different users to distinguish contributions
4. **Clearing Carefully**: Remember that clearing the canvas affects everyone, so confirm before doing so
5. **Reuse Room Codes**: For ongoing projects, reuse the same room code to access your previous work

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Can't Connect to Room**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you've entered the room code correctly
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Drawing Not Appearing for Others**:
   - Check the user count to confirm others are connected
   - Ensure your internet connection is stable
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **Saved Drawings Not Loading**:
   - Verify you're using the exact same room code as before
   - Check if more than 30 days have passed since last activity in the room
   - If still having issues, try clearing your browser cache
